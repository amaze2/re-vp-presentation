## Rationale / Significance

- Analyzing "Re-" is apt for text mining
    - small details: hard to notice with one's eyes, but easy to notice with computer "vision"
    - play with focus of analytic lens
        - (too-)close reading: microscopic aspects of language
        - distant reading: macroscopic methods of analysis

## Method

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - early research: explore data to discover trends and generate hypotheses / basic insights
- (simple) Count-based methods, rather than (complex) machine-  / deep-learning methods
    - Apt for EDA / early research, feature ("re-") analysis, smaller datasets
- Python (Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), Matplotlib)

## Who Uses "Re-" Words the Most / Least?: Theory

#### How

- Comparative Keyword Frequencies
    - Count re- words in each poet's corpus 
    - Normalize counts (percentage of whole) to enable comparison
        - divide # of re-words by # of words of each poet's corpus
    - Visualize each poet's percentage in bar chart

#### Why

- Who is (not) interested in "re-" words?

## Who Uses "Re-" Words the Most / Least?: Code
```{python}
import nltk

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

nltk.download('punkt')  # Download NLTK tokenizer data


# Define a function to remove all punctuation except hyphens
def remove_punctuation_except_hyphens(text):

    return text.translate(translator)

# Define a function to count "re-" words in a given text
def count_re_words(text):
    words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    return sum(1 for word in words if word.lower().startswith("re-"))

# Specify the directory paths for the two poets' corpora
corpus_directories = {
    'swinburne': '/home/adammazel/Documents/Digital_Scholarship/re-victorian-poetry/cta/swinburne/swinburne_noBP',
    'hardy': '/home/adammazel/Documents/Digital_Scholarship/re-victorian-poetry/cta/hardy/hardy_noBP',

# Read, tokenize, and calculate for each poet's corpus
for poet, corpus_directory in corpus_directories.items():
    corpus = []
    
    # Read and tokenize the text files in the poet's corpus
    for filename in os.listdir(corpus_directory):
        with open(os.path.join(corpus_directory, filename), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text = file.read()
            text = remove_punctuation_except_hyphens(text)
            corpus.append(text)

    # Count the "re-" words in the poet's corpus
    re_word_count = sum(count_re_words(text) for text in corpus)

    # Calculate the percentage of "re-" words in the poet's corpus
    total_words = sum(len(nltk.word_tokenize(text)) for text in corpus)
    percentage_re_words[poet] = (re_word_count / total_words) * 100

# Sort the results from largest to smallest
sorted_results = sorted(percentage_re_words.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Extract poets and percentages for plotting
poets, percentages = zip(*sorted_results)

# Step 4: Create a bar chart to visualize the results with dynamic y-axis limit and sorted labels
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.bar(poets, percentages, color=['blue', 'orange'])
plt.ylabel('Percentage (%)')
plt.title('Whose Poetry is More Composed of Words that Start with "Re-"?')

# Set the y-axis limit based on the largest percentage
ylim_percentage = max(percentages) * 2  # Adjusted for better visualization
plt.ylim(0, ylim_percentage)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)

# Display the bar chart

plt.show()
```

## Results: Take Aways

- Hardy: Uses "Re-" Words more
- Rossetti: Uses "Re-" Words less


## Which "Re-" Words Are Most Frequent: Theory

#### How

- Keyword Frequency
    - ID which re- words are used and count how often

#### Why

- Uncover meaningful patterns in language use
    - Significant terms
    - Style
    - Aboutness: Themes / Topics

## Which "Re-" Words Are Most Frequent: Code

- Have computer count all words that start with "re-" in poet's corpus + visualize results in bar chart
- Stemming
    - Remove inflected endings to condense different versions of same term to a common stem
    - "re-enter: 1", "re-entering: 1", "re-entered: 1" --> "re-ent: 3"
    - Improves IDing significant concepts

```{python}
 
# import software libraries / dependencies

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter
from nltk.stem import SnowballStemmer

nltk.download('punkt')  # Download NLTK tokenizer data

# create function to preprocess and process files of each directory
def process_directory(corpus_directory):   
    corpus = []

    # Get the directory name as the label
    label = os.path.basename(corpus_directory)

    # Step 1: Get the text of corpus from files
    for filename in os.listdir(corpus_directory):
        with open(os.path.join(corpus_directory, filename), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text = file.read()
            corpus.append(text)

    # Step 2: Tokenize the text blob into individual words
    tokenized_corpus = [nltk.word_tokenize(text) for text in corpus]

    # Step 3: Standardize (lower) case, find words that start with re-, stem those words, retain them
    stemmed_corpus = []
    for tokens in tokenized_corpus:
        stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(word.lower()) for word in tokens if re.match(r'\b(re-)\w+', word.lower())]
        stemmed_corpus.append(stemmed_tokens)

    # Step 6: Count the frequency of each re- word
    word_counts = Counter(word for tokens in stemmed_corpus for word in tokens)

    # Step 7: Display the most frequent words
    # most_common_re_words = word_counts.most_common(20)  # Set the desired number of top words
    # for word, count in most_common_re_words:
    #    print(f'The poetry of {label[:-5]} uses {word}: {count} times')

    # Step 8: Plot words and counts in a bar chart
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    top_words, top_counts = zip(*word_counts.most_common(20))
    plt.bar(top_words, top_counts)

```

## Results: Take Aways

- Keywords
    - Swinburne: "Re-Risen: 12" (80% of S's "Re-" Words)
        - "re-risen": content: interested in ressurection?
        - "re-risen: form: alliterative (more echoic than "ressurect")

## Results: Take Aways

- Comparison of "Re-" Use

|                    | Low Vocabulary | High Vocabulary |
|------------------- | ---------------| ----------------|
| **High Frequency** | Swinburne      |                 |
| **Low Frequency**  | Rossetti       | Hardy, Field    |

## Results: Take Aways

- Rossetti's "Re-Born"
    - Hapax Legomenon
        - ["Ardour & Memory"](http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/4-1873.tinkerms.rad.html) (1879), Sonnet LXIV, *House of Life* __Ballads and Sonnets__ (1881)
            - "The furtive flickering streams to light re-born / 'Mid airs new-fledged & valorous lusts of morn,"
        - But hyphenated prefixes (e.g. "a-heap", "to-night") and compound words (e.g. "cukoo-throb", "forest-boughs") are common (1.22%) in DGR
        - "ressurect*" appears only once, "born: 48" and "birth: 46" 
        - Hypotheses: uninterested in signifying repetition through "re-", more interested in birth than rebirth?

## Results: Take Aways

- Hardy  and Field: "Re-Illume" in Context
    - Extremely rare (OED Band 1)
    - Chiefly poetic
    - 1758 - present
    - Hardy: 2x
        - "Two Rosalinds": __Time's Laughingstocks and Other Verses__ (1909), "For Life I had never cared greatly": __Moments of Vision and Miscellaneous Verses__ (1917)
    - Field: 1x
        - ["XXII: Sleeping together: Sleep"](https://editions.covecollective.org/edition/whym-chow-flame-love/whym-chow-flame-love#chapter22): __Whym Chow: Flame of Love__ (1906, 1914)

## Results: Take Aways

    - rare word becoming obsolete
    - "re-illume" a word declining in use

## "Re-" Words in Context: Theory

#### How

- Bigrams (n-grams)
    - Bigrams: two consecutive words (Trigram: three consecutive words) 
        - e.g. "She used the olive oil.": "She used", "used the", "the olive", "olive oil"
    - ID / count bigrams of re- words: re- word + consecutive word

#### Why

- Key Word in Context: Know a word by the company it keeps: facilitaate understadning of key word
    - e.g. "olive", "oil"--> "olive oil"
- Better understand re- words by learning their immediate contexts and associations via frequently co-occuring terms
    - Fundamental method of text mining (TM)

## Which Words Adjoin "Re-" Words?: Code

- Have computer ID all the bigrams of each poet's works and then filter everything but bigrams of words that start with re- 
- remove stopwords (meaningless function words) to reveal associated concepts

```{python}
# import software dependencies / libraries
import nltk
import os
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.util import ngrams
from collections import Counter
import string
from nltk.stem import SnowballStemmer

}

# RegEx to match words starting with "re-"

# Dictionary to store directory/poet: bigram frequencies 
bigram_frequencies = {alias: Counter() for alias in corpus_directories.values()}

# Define the punctuation to remove (including curly quotation marks)
punctuation_to_remove = string.punctuation.replace('-', '') + "‘’“”"

# Preprocess and Process each directory
for corpus_directory, alias in corpus_directories.items():
    # Get the text from the text files in the corpus
    for filename in os.listdir(corpus_directory):
        if filename.endswith('.txt'):
            with open(os.path.join(corpus_directory, filename), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                text = file.read()

                # Tokenize the text
                tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)

                # Remove punctuation except hyphens and standardize case
                translator = str.maketrans('', '', punctuation_to_remove)
                preprocessed_text = ' '.join(tokens).translate(translator).lower()

                # Remove stopwords
                stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
                filtered_tokens = [word for word in preprocessed_text.split() if word not in stop_words]

                # Find bigrams
                bigrams = list(ngrams(filtered_tokens, 2))

                # Filter bigrams to include only those starting with "re-"
                re_bigrams = [bigram for bigram in bigrams if re.match(re_word_pattern, bigram[0])]

                # Count the bigrams
                bigram_frequency = Counter(re_bigrams)

                # Add the bigram frequencies as values of the current directory/poet as keys
                bigram_frequencies[alias].update(bigram_frequency)

# Print the sorted bigram frequencies per directory/poet

```

## Results: Take Aways

- Swinburne
    - "re-__" : "life", "dead" (2x), "dust", "mortal"
        - re- associated with life + death, mortality, etc.
    - "re-risen": "prison"
        - re-risen as internal rhyme: "re-" "-ri-" "pri-"
- Hardy
    - "re-____": "time" (2x), "semipiternal" (everlasting), "killing", "death", "lives" "new", "olden"
        - re- associated with time, eternal / mortal, etc.
- Field
    - "re-appear": "fade", "re-light": "tarnished"
        - re- used with opposites

## "Re-" Words in Context: "Re-" and "Re" Theory

#### How

- Return sentences that contain both a word(s) that start with "re-" and a word(s) that start with "re"

#### Why

- ID trend within trend
    - Does Hardy juxtapose "re-" words and "re" words? Do "re-" words and "re" words co-occur in Hardy's poetry?

## "Re-" Words in Context: Code

```{python}
import os
import nltk
import re
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize

nltk.download("punkt")

# Define regular expressions
re_pattern = r'\b(re)[a-zA-Z]+\b'  # Matches "re" followed by one or more letters
re_hyphen_pattern = r'\b(re-)\w+\b'  # Matches "re-" followed by one or more word characters

def matches_pattern(word, pattern):
    return re.search(pattern, word, re.IGNORECASE) is not None

# Function to replace matched words with bolded HTML tags
def bold_matched_words(match, pattern):
    return f'<b>{match.group()}</b>'

# Directory containing text files
text_directory = "/home/adammazel/Documents/Digital_Scholarship/re-victorian-poetry/cta/hardy/hardy_noBP"

# Iterate through text files in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(text_directory):
    if filename.endswith(".txt"):
        with open(os.path.join(text_directory, filename), "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            text = file.read()
            sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
            
            for sentence in sentences:
                words = word_tokenize(sentence)
                has_re = any(matches_pattern(word, re_pattern) for word in words)
                has_re_hyphen = any(matches_pattern(word, re_hyphen_pattern) for word in words)
                
                if has_re and has_re_hyphen:
                    sentence_with_bold = re.sub(re_pattern, lambda x: bold_matched_words(x, re_pattern), sentence)
                    sentence_with_bold = re.sub(re_hyphen_pattern, lambda x: bold_matched_words(x, re_hyphen_pattern), sentence_with_bold)
                    print(sentence_with_bold)
                    print("\n" * 2)
```

## Results: Take Aways

- 30% (6 / 20) of sentences containing "re-" words in Hardy's poetry also contain "re" words
- Hardy: "re-" words often juxtaposed with "re" words / "re-" words and "re" words co-occur in Hardy's poetry
    - "re" words derived from hyphenated "re-" prefix
- echo in form: visual and audial rhyme; echo in content: re(-) returns
- Hardy's style (microelement)


## When Were "Re-" Words More / Less Frequent: Theory

#### How

- Time Series / Term Frequency over Time
- ID when (in poet's career) "Re-" words were used more / less often

### Why

- When in poet's career did "re-" become more / less frequent
    - Why did "re-" wax / wane then?
- In which book(s) is re- frequent / infrequent? Why?

## When Were "Re-" Words More / Less Frequent: Code

- Computer counts what percent each book of poetry is "re-" words (total number of re- words divided by total number of words)
    - nomalizing the data enables comparison
- Y axis: re- word percentage of book; X axis: publication year of book

## Results: Take Aways

- Swinburne
    - "Re-": of interest in mid career, especially in __A Century of Roundels__ (1883)
        - "Re-" as theme of repetition apt for Roundel form: repetitive
- Field
    - "Re-": of very strong interest in __Whym Chow: Flame of Love__ (1914)
        - "Re-": intimates "again-ness", return, and memory: apt for an elegy (dog) 

## Are "Re-" Words Used Positively or Negatively? Theory

#### How

- Sentiment Analysis
- determines (part of) a text's emotional tone (positive / negative / neutral)

#### Why

- Opinion mining / reception
- Characters' sentiments / emotional arcs
- Sentiment of plot: ID emotional highs / lows
- Emotional valences / connotations of keywords ("Re-" words)
    - Stylistics: Author's tonal / emotional preferences
    - Comparison: compare how poets treat emotional associations of "Re-" words

## Are "Re-" Words Used Positively or Negatively? Code

- Sentiment Analyzer: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
    - lexicon-based approach
        - VADER employs a lexicon that contains thousands of words and their polarity scores, indicating whether the word is positive, negative, or neutral.
        - VADER also considers intensifiers (e.g., "very" or "extremely") that modify the sentiment of adjacent words.
        - VADER also considers punctuation, such as exclamation marks and question marks, which can influence sentiment.
        - VADER considers capitalization, giving more weight to fully capitalized words (e.g., "HAPPY") and less weight to words in all lowercase.
    - limitations: sarcasm, irony, or tone
- Sentiment Scores of Sentences with "Re-" Words
    - aggregate sentiment scores of all sentences with re- words
- Setiment Scores of each Corpus and
    - aggregate sentiment scores of entire corpus
    - serve as a norm against which to compare / contrast Sentiment Scores of Sentences with "Re-" Words

## Results: Take Aways

|                          | Poetry: More Positive | Poetry: More Negative |
|--------------------------| ----------------------| ----------------------|
| **"Re-": More Positive** | Field                 | Rossetti              |
| **"Re-": More Negative** | Swinburne             | Hardy                 |

- Field: Consistently Positive
- Hardy: Consistently Negative
- Swinburne: "Re-" tends to be in negative contexts / have negative connotations
    - ressurection / life after death: negative connotations for Swinburne?

## Conclusion

- Take Aways
    - small details (re-) <--> large data / methods / trends
    - No conclusions: EDA

- Next Steps
    - "re-" context / patterns in surrounding language
        - collocates
    - "re-" omissions
        - Why so rare in DGR?
    - Re-familiarize myself with poetry
    - Expand data / scope (other poets)

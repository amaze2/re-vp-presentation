Key Word in Context: Know a word by the company it keeps: facilitaate understadning of key word\n        - e.g. \"olive\", \"oil\"--> \"olive oil\"\n    - Better understand re- words by learning their immediate contexts and associations via frequently co-occuring terms\n    -

Code\n\n- Sentiment Analyzer: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)\n    - lexicon-based approach\n        - VADER employs a lexicon that contains thousands of words and their

words.\n        - VADER also considers punctuation, such as exclamation marks and question marks, which can influence sentiment.\n        - VADER considers capitalization, giving more weight to fully capitalized words (e.g., \"HAPPY\") and less weight to words in all lowercase.\n    - limitations: sarcasm, irony, or tone\n- Sentiment Scores of Sentences with \"Re-\" Words\n    - aggregate sentiment scores of all sentences with re- words\n- Setiment Scores of each Corpus and\n    - aggregate sentiment scores of entire corpus\n    - serve as a norm against which to compare / contrast

have negative connotations\n    - ressurection / life after death: negative connotations for Swinburne?\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- Take Aways\n    - small details (re-) <--> large data / methods / trends\n    - No conclusions: EDA\n\n- Next Steps\n    - \"re-\" context / patterns in surrounding language\n        - collocates\n    - \"re-\" omissions\n        - Why so rare in DGR?\n    - Re-familiarize myself with poetry\n    - Expand data / scope (other poets)\n\n- **Thank You!**\n- Contact Info\n    - Adam Mazel\n    - Digital Publishing Librarian\n    - Indiana University Bloomington\n    -
